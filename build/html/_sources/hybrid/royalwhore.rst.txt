.. _Royal Whore:

===================================
Anthurium Hybrid *Royal Whore*
===================================

:Section: Undocumented
:Creator: `Zen @zenm8 <https://instagram.com/zenm8>`_

Defining Characteristics
------------------------

*Royal Whore* has a bumpy texture, strong silver venation and various degrees of pink blush, some examples retaining the pink colour in the leaf sinus after hardening.


Parents
------------------------

Seed parent (left) is a *NOID* (suspected Velvet Shadow hybrid) - bumpy texture and dark blurple leaves as they harden. The main unexplained characteristic of this plant is the striking venation pattern which looks similar to Magnificum or Regale. The petiole shape is round. Interestingly, the seed parent is a great seed mother but has never produced pollen.

Pollen parent (right) is *Crystallinum*.
